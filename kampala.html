		<h2 class="gallery-title">Kampala from the Inside Out</h2>
		<p>In the winter of 2010 I traveled to Uganda to teach photography classes to the women and youth who live in the slums of Kampala. My goal was to give them a chance to explore their world using photography. I was interested in what they would choose to document, what they found interesting and what they wanted to share with others - specifically me, an outsider. At the same time I was also documenting what I found interesting and unusual.</p>
		
		<p>A photograph can be a window into other cultures. Often these images are taken by outsiders and color a viewer's perception of reality. The power of a photograph lies with what the photographer chooses to include or not to include, which could change the conveyed meaning. This documentary, Kampala from the Inside Out, attempts to subvert the traditional balance of power by combining images captured by an outsider and insiders to tell a more comprehensive story.</p>
